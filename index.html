    <h2>What People Are Saying</h2>
    <div class="swiper">
      <div class="swiper-wrapper">
        <div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“… The course which I already marked ’F’ from the beginning of the semester came out as an ’A’ for me. Shocking, right? That was because of those tutorial classes organized by Team A. To even crown it all, there was never a semester that I wrote exams without having a ’D’ or ’E’ in my result, but that second semester 300L, I got just one C, and the rest were all A’s and B’s.” — Joseph Jeremaih, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“I’ve always known EEE to have some of the brightest students in the faculty, and I’m confident that the Team A community will help uphold that reputation.” — Aken Victor, Academic Advisor - Team A</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“I also joined Team A, where I met incredible individuals. The team is like a family: they’re supportive, willing to help, and dedicated to helping you learn as long as you’re willing to put in the effort.” — Deborah Onyenaturuchi</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“As early as 300 level, he was already thinking about how to ensure everyone excelled. He created Team A, a study group with the motto: ‘For anyone in Team A to say ‘I failed this course,’ it means they got a C.’ In other words, a C was considered an F in his group.” — Odiagbe Onolunose Gabriel, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“The idea behind Team A is simple but powerful, creating a system that supports students in securing as many A’s as possible. It wasn’t just about organizing study sessions or providing academic orientation; it was about fostering a mindset of excellence and equipping students with strategies and resources they needed to succeed.” — Emmanuel Imasogie</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“He started the Team A group. It initially began as Team C for an F. He would sacrifice his time to teach anyone willing to listen, both before classes and after they ended, which was truly remarkable, solving past questions with dedication. Eventually, it evolved into Team A. One of the best things about Team A was that it created an avenue for students who couldn’t ask questions in class to bring their concerns and have them addressed by the class scholars. … To be completely honest, I don’t know about others, but Emmanuel has been an incredibly huge academic blessing in my life.” — Kalikwu Goodnews Onyeka, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“I was fortunate to be part of one of the academic team. He believed in inclusivity, making sure that everyone had the opportunity to learn and grow.” — Ehi-iyamu Kelly</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“Team A assisted me academically by providing access to reading materials, past questions, notes, and other essential resources that helped me excel in my studies.” — Timothy Ayodele, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“Team A is dedicated to grooming students academically, mentoring and supporting fellow students, and fostering a collaborative learning environment that encourages intellectual discourse and academic success. Leadership within Team A is evident in the ability to inspire and guide peers, offering valuable insights and support to those seeking academic improvement.” — Adogbeji Samuel. O, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“The core vision of Team A is to achieve outstanding results with integrity and dignity, both academically and in all aspects of life.” — Kelvin Ibamheyi</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“I perceived Team A to be a really good community that was created by Emmanuel, and how he inspired people with the belief that everyone could get an A no matter what they thought about themselves — that no one was above getting an A in any course they wrote. Just creating the community made everyone comfortable enough to ask questions and share their opinions about various topics and answers to past questions, and it was a beautiful thing.” — Serena</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“Team A platform aims to groom students facing academic difficulties, focusing on improving their understanding of challenging courses. Most importantly, it allows anyone to voluntarily and willingly share their knowledge with the less privileged.” — Egene Victor</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“Team A initiative he created is a legacy that will endure for a very long time. It is a platform where students can help each other academically and gain far more than most lectures provide. Team A is one of the very few programs I can confidently recommend to anyone seeking academic growth and community.” — Uwadia Isaiah</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“What truly set him apart, however, was his initiative in forming ‘Team A’, a group he created to organize tutorials for classmates and even students in lower levels. Through these sessions, he patiently guided us to deepen our understanding of challenging courses, reflecting both his technical competence and his desire to see others succeed.” — Eghosasere Eghomwanre</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“Emmanuel demonstrates diligence in achieving goals and overcoming challenges. He also provides encouragement, guidance, and resources to help others grow and succeed. Moreover, he strives to inspire and motivate others to work towards a common goal — a very rare personality in general.” — Adrian Abode, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“Team A helps students better understand their courses, primarily to promote independence in the exam hall. Team A at University of Benin not only improves grades but also boosts spirits and creates a sense of community.” — Olofinbiyi Precious Ilerioluwa - President, SEEES 23/24, University of Benin</blockquote></div>

<div class="swiper-slide"><blockquote>“The Team A project to my class was a peer-to-peer academic support initiative that fostered a collaborative learning environment. … Efforts in developing and leading this team were invaluable, and his ability to break down complex concepts into understandable terms was impressive.” — Osemeke John, SEC GEN 23/24, SEEES, University of Benin</blockquote></div>
